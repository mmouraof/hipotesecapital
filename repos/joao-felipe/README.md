# Equity Research Briefing

Phase 1 prototype of a local Streamlit app that generates an equity research briefing for one allowed B3 ticker at a time.

## Purpose

The app collects public information about a selected company, combines company and market data with recent news, and sends the result to an LLM to produce a concise buy-side style briefing.

## Phase 1 scope

- one-ticker briefing flow
- restricted ticker universe
- company overview from public sources
- current quote and selected fundamentals
- simple returns chart with switchable windows
- up to 5 recent news items
- LLM-generated structured analysis
- minimal Streamlit interface

## Supported tickers

- ASAI3
- RECV3
- MOVI3
- BRKM5
- HBSA3
- ITUB4
- BBDC4
- OPCT3
- BRSR6
- PRIO3

```

## Setup

1. Use Python 3.10 or newer.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the LLM credentials:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini
```

`OPENAI_BASE_URL` is optional if you want to point the app to another OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## How it works

- The B3 listed-companies JSON endpoint is used to resolve company name, CVM code, and B3 segment.
- Yahoo Finance is used as the first source for fundamentals such as P/L, ROE, Net Margin, Dividend Yield, EBITDA, and Net Debt.
- CVM open-data files are used for sector, business description, shares outstanding, and fallback accounting-based fundamentals.
- Status Invest JSON endpoints are used for current price, price history, and provents-based dividend inputs.
- Google News RSS is used to collect up to five recent public news items.
- The LLM receives a structured payload and returns JSON with:
  - business summary
  - fundamentals interpretation
  - news synthesis
  - three analyst questions

## Notes for evaluators

- If some data points are unavailable from the public sources, the app shows `Unavailable` instead of failing.
- If the LLM call fails, the app still renders the company, market, and news sections so the briefing remains usable.
- The design is intentionally small and pragmatic so it is easy to run locally and easy to explain in an interview.
